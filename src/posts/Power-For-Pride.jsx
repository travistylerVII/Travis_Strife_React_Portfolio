          <p>
            Power for pride is an unconventional spin on active fundraising â€” a
            deadlifting event designed to raise money and build awareness for
            Minneapolis homeless youth.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was a custom Leadpages landing page theme request designed for
            a fitness client based in Minneapolis.

          What was nice about this project was that the copy and branding guide
          was provided. I love projects when the client provides much of the
          heavy lifting.
        </p>
        <p>
          With not having to write creative copy and having to determine what
          the colors and style should be, the design turnaround time was
          lightning speed.
        </p>
        <p>The design was created in Photoshop.</p>

        <p>Now on to the development part...</p>
        <p>
          Overall developing a basic page like this is extremely simple.
          Hardcoding just takes some simple HTML and CSS and with Bootstrap as a
          framework, like the one I used for this project, this takes less than
          an hour to complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in this case, I had to integrate it with the Leadpages (Now
          Legacy) Landing page editor at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          That required me to hardcode each div element of the landing page into
          a JSON object so their landing page editor can use it. Needless to
          say, this was a time-consuming process.
